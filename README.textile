Then go to application folder and do
@bundle install --path vendor/bundle@

Now you need to install mongodb.
If you are using OSX it could very helpful to use homebrew for this purposes:
@brew install mongodb@

To apply index for mongodb you need to execute
@bundle exec rake db:mongoid:create_indexes@

After installing mongodb start this database and then simply launch application with:
@bundle exec rails s@

If you want to see all models of app you need to execute next:
@be railroady -M -e app/models/ability.rb | neato -Tpng > controllers.png@
It will be generated a picture in root of the app named *controllers.png*
