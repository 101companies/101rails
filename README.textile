h2. Getting Started

Install ruby (version 1.9.3) and gem bundle. (by using *gem install bundler*)
Then go to application folder and do
@bundle install --path vendor/bundle@

Now you need to install mongodb.
If you are using OSX it could very helpful to use homebrew for this purposes:
@brew install mongodb@

If you will test this application locally in production mode, you also need to install Redis
@brew install redis@

To apply index for mongodb you need to execute
@bundle exec rake db:mongoid:create_indexes@
Indexes are using for unique keys in db.

Creating indexes need to be done after adding any new model with indexes or changing old models with indexes.

After installing mongodb start this database and then launch application with:
@bundle exec rails s@

If you want to see all models of app you need to execute next:
@be railroady -M -e app/models/ability.rb | neato -Tpng > controllers.png@
It will be generated a picture in root of the app named *controllers.png*
