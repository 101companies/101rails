101wiki web app written using Ruby on Rails.

## Software dependencies

Before starting work with the application, you need to install such dependencies, if you are using Ubuntu:

    apt-get install postfix curl git-core zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev
      libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev postgresql-server-dev-all postgresql-contrib build-essential nodejs ruby2.3 ruby2.3-dev htop postgresql-9.5 postgresql-client bundler

## Ruby

With OSX you already have Ruby.

If you are using Ubuntu you can install ruby via [rvm](http://rvm.io) or [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/).

This app was tested with ruby 2.3.0-2.3.3.

## Installing the app

At first you need to install **bundler** gem.

    gem install bundler

Now you need go to the project folder und install app:

    bundle install

You need a postgres dump which must be acquired from the 101companies admins.
If you have a dump load it like this:

    cat wiki_db.gz | gunzip | psql wiki_development

After setting up the database you need to start it and then launch application with:

    bin/rails s

## Admin rights

To be signed in you need to have GitHub account with **name** and **public email** in GitHub profile.

    bundle exec rake change_role

You will be asked for your email and new role. Just type email from your GitHub account and role **admin**.
