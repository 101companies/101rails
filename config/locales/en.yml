To this end, 101explorer provides access to the various links between all the involved resources. In other words, 101explorer is the Linked Data portal for the 101project. 101explorer is organized as web service (using HTTP GET) with the URL referring to the resource and the response containing information about the resource. Different response formats are supported: HTML, JSON, and RDF.'
